## Time Lapse Rec

Application for creating time-lapse screen recordnigs. Main purpose is creating speed-up "making of"
videos of digital artwork. For Windows only.

## Features:

* Records entire screen or specific window/windows.
* Select time-lapse multiplier 1x/2x/4x/8x/16x
* Recording pauses when window is idle (Not recieving windows events). Thus reducing file size.

## TODO:

- [ ] Update UI for window selection
- [ ] Get rid of pesky QML binding loops
- [ ] Refactor usage of QThread
- [ ] Implement frameless window
